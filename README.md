# Morals Matter, But Not For Everyone
## The Conditionality of Moral Foundations in Political Reasoning

### Abstract
This study explores the role of morality in political reasoning by analyzing whether and how individuals evoke moral considerations when discussing their political beliefs. The proposed measurement approach identifies references to moral intuitions in open-ended responses using a dictionary previously validated in the literature on moral foundations. The analyses demonstrate systematic ideological differences in moral reasoning and extend previous findings by showing that the expression of moral considerations is conditional on individual political knowledge and exposure to political discourse. Moral arguments have a powerful influence on public opinion and political behavior but this relationship is most evident among the politically knowledgeable---implying that moral foundations are as much learned from the political world as they are innate.
