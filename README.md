# Moral Foundations of Political Reasoning
## Investigating the Moral Underpinnings of Political Judgment

### Abstract
Moral Foundations Theory suggests that political attitudes and ideology are shaped and structured by fundamental moral intuitions. However, recent research casts doubt on the theory's basic tenets, such as whether moral foundations are indeed heritable and more stable than ideology. This paper explores the notion that moral foundations in politics might not reflect an underlying stable trait but should rather be viewed as a context dependent application of moral considerations in political reasoning. Using open-ended survey responses in the 2012 American National Election Study, I utilize a moral dictionary proposed in the literature on Moral Foundations Theory to identify references to basic moral intuitions when individuals report their attitudes towards political parties and candidates. I show that the reliance on moral foundations in political judgment is conditional on campaign exposure and engagement. The findings indicate that moral foundations are evoked to justify beliefs and preferences in a given political context and are therefore less stable than Moral Foundations Theory initially suggested.
