- I should add analyses that show that I can predict voting behavior by using the open-ended responses!!!

- I should think about a middle ground between the merging of all responses for one individual and looking at every single response. For example, it could make sense to aggregate responses for candidate/party that is consistent/inconsistent or for example for like vs. dislike task. I could reduce the number of missings by aggregating the 8 items in 2 groups like that and still have some info about the item task

- use pre-election survey, since open-ended questions were asked in pre wave

modeling strategy:
1) logit model: mentioning any moral foundation?
2) multiple logits: mentioning each of the moral foundations
3) conditional logit: response pattern determined by most prevalent moral foundation
4) non-exclusive multinomial choice model / poisson-multinomial

- check response from stanley for review paper for arguments about causality: in how far is it possible to deduce moral reasoning in politics from open survey responses

IDEAS FOR FUTURE STUDIES:
- effects of campaign exposure
- closer look at differences b/w survey questions: pro/con, party/cand
- talk about possibility of structured topic models etc.
- effects of political discussions, political networks, network coherence etc.
- question: do partisans differ with regard to the degree to which they rely on moral foundations depending on in-party/out-party candidates?
- difference b/w positive and negative evaluations?
- other sources of heterogeneity: strength of partisanship/ideology?
- the anes 2012 also contains a big 5 battery, it would be nice to combine personality and moral foundations in a subsequent study.

NOTES:
- check whether standard deviation in plots is correct: se instead of sd! -> sqrt(sd^2/N)
