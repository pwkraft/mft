public service I was just commenting with my wife I realize that PBS the channel that kids wat I realize they are very useful that my childrens age is nice to have it puts them in an advantage its a very educational show I guess in his debate he made a better point than his opponent Romney with his plans to improve Universitites teachers students 3 Coming from my background a very poor i guess low income hardworking class my parents and I we were hard workers in middle class because the majority of my family are either middler class or lower class tht the ideas he expressed in his deba","unemployment 2 maybe it s me but I m not aware of his strategy on gun control I know in his debate he mentioned that s addressed every thing comes from educationa nd family values but that cannot be the answer to everything There should be a sedcond plan on family values his answer was reactive instead of proactive being proactive is better you minimize the current violence that is happendning every day out there putting technology not just education I m process driven that putting a a fix to this problem gun control etc is easily attained putting meassures in the manufacturers so these things don t happen","1 someone new new change basically nes ideas the current president i don t feel we are better off than we were 4 years ago unemployment all the facts that come up 4 years later statistics facts of what he has accomplished make me feel that a newchange giving somone the opportunity can help us right 2 I like his proposal on fair trade and Romney s debates he mentioned something that interested me put in rules in China make sure there is a comparitive equaalness between imports and exports 3 In Romney s debate he mentioned about Latin America being

questionable and again I m embarrased to say that Another item even more important is the fact that even though he seems to comewith new ideas like China ruels in place with imports and exports i
